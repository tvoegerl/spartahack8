                If you have a hard time creating an email yourself, google will try to offer suggestions based on what you wrote in order to give you a unique name. This is indicated above with the blue words after “available”. <br>
                Lastly, create your password. In order to do so follow the rules that Google provides. Please make sure it is easy for you to remember, but isn't something that others could guess. Once you have chosen your password hit next.  <br>
                They will ask for you to verify you're phone number with a text that they sent you &mdash; Take the #'s after the G and type them into the respective space give and hit the verification button.

                <p>Take a look at the box menu to the left of your screen. This is where most of your Gmail functionality resides.
                    Inbox: this is the “box” where any and all emails sent to you will come in. You can click on any email that resides in this box and read it's contents.
                    <ul>

                        <li>Sent: Any emails that you send will be saved here.</li>
                        <li>Drafts: Any messages that you have written up but haven't sent quite yet will be here.</li>

                <p>If you hit “Compose” you should see this box pop up in the bottom right-hand corner. This is the box you will write all of your messages in. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>To: This is where you will enter all the email of the person you wish to send an email to. Note that you can list multiple emails here in order to send it to 2 or more people.</li>
                        <li>Subject: Think of this as the title of an essay. This is the first thing the reader of the email sees. The subject should match the contents of the email.</li>
                        <li>Cc: allows you to add in someone to an email to read the email, but the message is not intended for them specifically.</li>
                        <li>Bcc: This allows you to send emails to multiple people but does not let the receivers see each others email addresses.</li>
                    </ul>
                Now take a look an the bottom of this same box, you should see an array of icons. The first and most important, the send button. If you click the down arrow you'll see the option schedule send. <br>
                This schedule send option lets you send a message at a specific time in the future. If you simply click send it will send the message immediately. <br>
                The next most important icon is that of a paper-clip. This allows you to attach files from your computer into your messages. File types you can add PDFs, photos,videos, and word documents. <br>

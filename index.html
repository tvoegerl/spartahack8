            <h3>Use</h3>
            <p>
                Use divide refers to the lack of digital skills when using digital technologies and the internet. People experiencing the use divide have access to the internet but do not have the proper skills to utilize that access yet.

            <h3>Quality</h3>
            <p>
                Quality of Use gap occurs when a user has the skills to utilize their access to the internet, but lacks the knowledge about how to make good use of it. This can refer to the quality of information they can use as well as getting the most use out of their internet access. This gap, combined with the use divide, makes up the digital literacy divide.
